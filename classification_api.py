Supreme Court of Missouri, En Banc. November 19, 1991 Page 732        Stephen L. Shepard, Springfield, for plaintiff-appellant.        Rob J. Aiken, Springfield, for defendant-respondent.        ROBERTSON, Chief Justice.        Here we consider whether the remarriage of a former spouse terminates an obligation to pay the remaining monthly installments of a lump sum maintenance award when the decree of dissolution and the separation agreement are silent on that issue. The trial court sustained the husband\'s Motion to Quash Garnishment, holding that the wife\'s remarriage terminates the husband\'s obligation to continue payment. The Court of Appeals, Southern District, affirmed. We granted transfer to resolve the conflict that appears throughout appellate decisions, of which the southern district\'s opinion in this case and Mika v. Mika, 728 S.W.2d 280 (Mo.App.1987), are representative. We have jurisdiction. Mo. Const. art. V, § 10. The cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. I.        The Circuit Court of Greene County dissolved the marriage of Larry and Rochelle Cates on May 24, 1988. The trial court\'s decree found """"[t]here is a necessity to award maintenance in gross to Petitioner Page 733 [Rochelle], in the amount of Seven Thousand Eight Hundred ($7,800) Dollars, payable at the rate of Three Hundred Twenty Five ($325) Dollars per month ... as more specifically set out in the Property Settlement and Separation Agreement"""" and ordered Larry to pay accordingly. The decree approved and incorporated the Property Settlement and Separation Agreement (separation agreement), finding that agreement """"fair and not unconscionable.""""        The separation agreement stated in pertinent part:        5. Maintenance. Husband acknowledges certain obligations to Wife that have arisen from the marital relationship, and the parties, after giving due consideration to all relevant factors for the award of maintenance, including those set forth in RSMo. 453.335, the difference in earning power between them, the need for maintenance and the benefits that would have accrued to Wife from the continuation of the marriage, agree that the Wife is entitled to maintenance. Accordingly, Husband shall pay to Wife, as maintenance in gross, the sum of Seven Thousand Eight Hundred ($7,800.00) Dollars, payable at the rate of Three Hundred Twenty Five ($325.00) Dollars per month.... * * * * * *        The parties acknowledge that the above described maintenance provisions are intended to constitute """"alimony"""" within the meaning of Section 71(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 ... thus constituting gross income to Wife and a deductible expense to Husband.... * * * * * *        This support obligation is not related to the division of property and is not intended in any way to constitute a form of payment for any rights or interests of the Wife.        The maintenance hereinbefore provided shall be deemed contractual in nature, not subject to modification by the Court and subject to modification by the parties in writing.        Rochelle remarried on June 1, 1989. Larry stopped his monthly maintenance payments. Rochelle attempted to garnish Larry\'s earnings. Larry filed a Motion to Quash Garnishment, which the trial court sustained. This appeal followed. II. A.        Mika v. Mika, 728 S.W.2d 280, 285 (Mo.App.1987), holds that monthly payments made pursuant to a maintenance in gross award are not terminated on the remarriage of the receiving spouse: The trial court awarded the wife periodic maintenance payments of $2,450.00 a month for the next ten years. This type of an award is the equivalent of a lump sum award or an award in gross and is nonmodifiable. [Citations omitted.] The award also survives remarriage or death.        [Emphasis added.] In Nelson v. Nelson, 720 S.W.2d 947 (Mo.App.1986) (Nelson II ), the court considered whether an award of maintenance in gross payable in installments may terminate on death or remarriage. The court said: It is evident that the obligation to pay future statutory maintenance term of § 452.370.2 is meant to be understood in terms of maintenance § 452.335. The temper of that statute, as we note, is that support shall not continue beyond actual dependency.... In terms of the purpose of maintenance within the integral Dissolution of Marriage Act, therefore, the obligation to pay future statutory maintenance can only mean reasonably that the death or remarriage of a dependent spouse terminates the obligation of the other spouse to pay the installments....        Id. at 954. [Emphasis in original.] The southern district relied on Nelson II in reaching its decision in this case.        It would serve little purpose to lay out the various decisions of the court of appeals on the issue presented in this case. The cases tend to turn on their individual factual idiosyncracies. For our purposes, it Page 734 is sufficient to acknowledge that the courts have not spoken uniformly on this issue, and Mika and Nelson II are representative of the conflict between the cases. B.        Dissolution of marriage is a statutory action, unknown to the common law. The statutes relating to dissolution of marriage, Sections 452.300-.420, RSMo 1986, thus dictate the nature of the action, its breadth, the authority of the parties to agree, or the court to order, property settlement and support obligations and the manner in which decrees and agreements entered under the statute will be interpreted.        Specifically relevant to this case, Section 452.325, RSMo 1986, authorizes separation agreements. Section 452.335, RSMo 1986, outlines the factors that a court must consider before awarding a spouse maintenance. These factors form the basis of a trial court\'s determination of the conscionability of maintenance in a separation agreement. Section 452.370.2, RSMo 1986, [1] creates a rebuttable presumption that the obligation to pay statutory maintenance terminates upon the remarriage of the receiving party or the death of either party. Unless otherwise agreed in writing or expressly provided in the decree, the obligation to pay future statutory maintenance is terminated upon the death of either party or the remarriage of the party receiving maintenance.        The statutory presumption is rebutted by an agreement in writing that the obligation to pay statutory maintenance extends beyond remarriage or death. The presumption is also rebutted by a decree of dissolution expressly extending the obligation to pay future statutory maintenance beyond the death of either party or the remarriage of the receiving party.        In order to determine whether Larry\'s maintenance obligation in this case extends beyond Rochelle\'s remarriage, the first consideration is whether the maintenance award here is statutory maintenance. If so, the inquiry moves to consider whether monthly payments, not yet due on the maintenance award, are future payments. If both of these questions are answered affirmatively, the analysis next focuses on whether the trial court\'s decree of dissolution expressly provides for continued maintenance payments beyond remarriage or whether the written separation agreement extends Larry\'s obligation to make monthly payments beyond the time of Rochelle\'s remarriage. 1.        In 1973, the General Assembly adopted an act permitting dissolution of marriage in Missouri. Popularly dubbed a """"no fault"""" divorce law, see generally, Krauskopf, Maintenance: Theory and Negotiation, 33 J.Mo.Bar (1977), the new act repealed Missouri\'s statutes permitting divorce and changed the philosophical moorings for support for a former spouse.        Under the new act, courts no longer award alimony; instead, courts award maintenance. The distinction is more than one of semantics.        Alimony served """"as the equivalent of that obligation for support which arises in favor of the wife out of the marriage contract."""" Nelson v. Nelson, 282 Mo. 412, 221 S.W. 1066, 1067 (banc 1920) (Nelson I ). """"In this limited sense [alimony] may be deemed an assessment of damages in [the wife\'s] favor for breach of the contract by the husband."""" Id. 221 S.W. at 1069.        Maintenance, on the other hand, proceeds from """"the need for reasonable support by one spouse from the other after the disruption of the marriage."""" Nelson II, 720 S.W.2d at 952. Under the statute, the court can award maintenance only where the court finds that the receiving spouse """"(1) [l]acks sufficient property ... to provide for his reasonable needs; and (2) [i]s unable to support himself through appropriate employment."""" Page 735 Section 452.335.1. [Emphasis added.] Thus, """"maintenance issues for support and only for support--and then, until the dependent spouse achieves a reasonable self-sufficiency."""" Nelson II, 720 S.W.2d at 952.        In Doerflinger v. Doerflinger, 646 S.W.2d 798 (Mo. banc 1983), this Court determined that """"Section 452.335 ... covers the full range of support payments to a spouse, maintenance for an indefinite term, maintenance for a limited period and maintenance in gross."""" Id. at 800. Thus, the Court concluded that """"awards of maintenance in gross derive their origin in Section 452.335."""" Id. at 801.        The phrase """"maintenance in gross"""" does not appear in the dissolution of marriage statutes. It appears that the legislature\'s failure to recognize """"maintenance in gross"""" is not the product of an oversight. Section 452.080, which the General Assembly did not repeal, refers to alimony in gross and, we speculate, survived the 1973 amendments to permit enforcement of alimony judgments entered prior to the effective date of the laws relating to dissolution of marriage.        Because maintenance is founded on need, a maintenance award may extend only so long as the need exists. As the statute is cast, therefore, it would make little sense for the law to countenance a lump sum or """"gross"""" award based on need which was not subject to modification. Thus, the dissolution of marriage statutes appear to contemplate a lump sum or gross payment only as a division of property.        In an apparent attempt to accommodate historical terms, Doerflinger departs from the statutes by recognizing """"maintenance in gross"""" as a component of dissolution of marriage. Absent the requisite statutory predicate for maintenance in gross, we believe that Doerflinger misstates the law by recognizing """"maintenance in gross"""" under the dissolution of marriage laws.        Doerflinger\'s error in recognizing maintenance in gross notwithstanding, Doerflinger is correct, however, in its broad holding that maintenance finds its origin in Section 452.335. This is reflected in the parties\' separation agreement in this case, which expressly states that the parties have given consideration """"to all relevant factors for the award of maintenance, including those set forth in RSMo. 452.335."""" Moreover, that agreement states that """"[t]his support obligation is not related to the division of property and is not intended in any way to constitute a form of payment for any rights or interests of the Wife."""" We conclude, therefore, that the maintenance award under consideration here is statutory maintenance within the meaning of Section 452.370.2. 2.        We turn now to consider whether the monthly payments not yet due on the maintenance award are future payments.        In support of her position that the maintenance award in this case survives her remarriage, Rochelle contends that Section 452.335.2 authorizes the award of a fixed sum of maintenance payable in installments. However denominated, this maintenance does not terminate upon the happening of a future event, she urges, despite the express language of Section 452.370.2. Her agreement to accept monthly payments, to which the trial court assented, is but a measure of her and the court\'s grace, which avoids undue economic hardship for Larry, she contends. She relies on Doerflinger and Mika.        Doerflinger considered the question """"whether the wife is entitled to seek modification of an award of maintenance of limited duration by filing a motion within the period of installment payments."""" 646 S.W.2d at 798. This Court held that modification of a maintenance in gross award is not contemplated by the dissolution of marriage statutes, saying, """"That decision ... [to award maintenance in gross is] a final adjudication on the subject spouse\'s financial dependency and is not reviewable through a modification motion."""" Id. at 801. Rochelle seizes on this """"final adjudication"""" language as dispositive of her point.        Rochelle\'s reliance on Doerflinger is misplaced. While Doerflinger properly recognizes Page 736 that the parties to a separation agreement may agree that maintenance may not be modified, that case did not consider the question whether an award of maintenance terminates upon remarriage of the receiving spouse. The unstated assumption of Doerflinger is that the receiving spouse\'s need continues for the life of the maintenance """"in gross"""" obligation. This is contrary to Section 452.370.2 which presumes that need terminates upon remarriage absent a contrary written declaration by the court or the parties.        Nor does Mika assist Rochelle. Mika holds that monthly payments made pursuant to a maintenance """"in gross"""" award are not terminated on the remarriage of the receiving spouse. """"The trial court awarded the wife periodic maintenance payments of $2,450.00 per month for the next ten years. This type of award is the equivalent of a lump sum award or an award in gross and is non-modifiable. [Citations omitted.] The award also survives remarriage or death.""""        Mika is incorrect because it draws no distinction between alimony and maintenance, assuming for purposes of its reasoning that alimony and maintenance are the same. As we have already said, they are not.        Maintenance awards under Section 452.335 serve the purpose of permitting the receiving spouse to readjust financially during a period of dependency until that spouse can achieve a reasonable measure of self-sufficiency. Where the trial court, as here, assumed the viability of the concept of """"in gross"""" maintenance, it (and the parties) also assumed the prescience to determine the amount of funding and time achievement ',

Elliott L. HYMAN and Joseph G. Hyman, Plaintiffs, v. UNIVERSITY CAFETERIA, INC., Defendant. Bankruptcy No. 683-01043. Adv. No. 683-0023. Civ. A. No. 84-0051-C. United States District Court, W.D. Virginia. February 7, 1985         Paul M. Peatross, Jr., Larry J. McElwain, Charlottesville, Va., for plaintiffs.         Douglas E. Little, Charlottesville, Va., for defendant.         MEMORANDUM OPINION         TURK, Chief Judge.         In this appeal from a Chapter 11 adversary proceeding, plaintiffs seek to terminate a lease for failure to pay rent. At issue is a lease agreement between plaintiffs\' predecessor-in-interest and University Page 405 Cafeteria as lessor and lessee, respectively. The lease obligated University Cafeteria, the debtor, to operate continuously as a cafeteria or restaurant and to pay """"monthly rental of 3% on gross business done on the premises,"""" never to be less than $300.00 per month. The lease further provided for termination upon lessee\'s failure to pay rent for 60 days.         Plaintiffs Elliott and Joseph Hyman purchased the property from George Gilmer, Jr., in June 1983. At that time, University Cafeteria had given second-floor subleases to three apartments and a retail dress shop. Debtor has never calculated and paid rent on the basis of income derived from these subleases or from any source other than food sales.         Although the lease forbade assignment or subletting without the express written consent of the lessor or his assign, Gilmer testified at trial that he did not consider the sublets of which he was aware to be violations of the lease. Immediately upon acquiring the property, however, plaintiffs demanded that debtor terminate the upstairs subleases. University Cafeteria refused to do so, and the Hymans commenced the adversary proceeding.         Plaintiffs argued for termination on two grounds: the unauthorized subleases and debtor\'s payment of rent based only on the gross business done by University Cafeteria itself. Under the bankruptcy court\'s construction of the lease, rent would include a percentage of """"food sales, liquor, video sales and rent [derived from the subleases]."""" Apparently finding the subleases not violative of the lease, the court held that University Cafeteria had defaulted on the lease but could cure the default under § 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. 11 U.S.C. § 365. The court\'s order permitted the debtor to assume the lease, provided it paid the overdue rent by July 9, 1984.         Plaintiffs now appeal the bankruptcy court\'s determination that debtor may cure its default under § 365. Debtor contends that there was, in fact, no default, since rent was not to include a percentage of the income derived from subleases, video games, or special charges. Conversely, plaintiffs argue that they should receive a percentage of the gross business done by the retail sublessees and of the income derived from all other moneymaking operations on the premises.          Section 365, on which the bankruptcy court predicated debtor\'s right to cure, applies only before confirmation of the reorganization plan. Here confirmation occurred on September 30, 1981, well before the cafeteria\'s breach against plaintiffs in 1983. The bankruptcy court\'s reliance on § 365, therefore, was ill-placed.          Section 1127(b) of the Bankruptcy Code governs once the plan has been confirmed and permits modification only if """"substantial consummation of the plan"""" has not yet occurred. As defined in § 1101(2) of the Code, """"substantial consummation"""" means         (A) transfer of all or substantially all of the property proposed by the plan to be transferred;         (B) assumption by the debtor or by the successor to the debtor under the plan of the business or of the management of all or substantially all of the property dealt with by the plan; and         (C) commencement of distribution under the plan.         Because the plan in question had thus been substantially consummated at the time of default, it may no longer be modified. In the absence of applicable provisions in the Bankruptcy Code, this court turns to Virginia law.          Although University Cafeteria did default on the lease, the bankruptcy court correctly found that such default was occasioned by the ambiguity in the lease provision setting rent as a percentage of gross business. This court must now determine, first, how properly to construct the percentage rent provision and, then, how to enforce the lease in light of its ambiguity.         The bankruptcy court held that """"3% of the gross business done on the premises"""" Page 406. should be calculated on the basis of """"food sales, liquor, video sales and rent."""" Plaintiffs have not persuaded this court that it should second-guess the trial court\'s interpretation of that clause. Indeed, the Virginia rule of construction would favor the lessee where, as here, the lease was prepared by the lessor. Monterey Corp. v. Hart, 216 Va. 843, 845, 224 S.E.2d 142, 144 (1976).          Notwithstanding this favorable construction, debtor clearly failed to comply with the lease and may not cure its default under § 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. Termination of the lease is not, however, the inevitable consequence. Indeed, such harsh enforcement of the lease agreement would conflict with a basic principle of Virginia law: The general principle that contractual provisions for forfeiture are looked upon with disfavor by the courts is applicable to contracts of lease. Such stipulations are strictly construed and when they are invoked by a landlord for nonpayment of rent, equity may relieve against them if complete justice can be done by the payment or tender of the arrears. It is recognized that payment of the rent is the object of the contract, and that the provision for forfeiture is inserted to insure this result.         Galvin v. Southern Hotel Corp., 154 F.2d 970, 973 (4th Cir.1946) (applying Virginia law). In the instant case, plaintiffs could be made whole by debtor\'s mere payment of arrearages, plus appropriate interest. That the default was the result of an ambiguity in the lease lends further support of debtor\'s argument against termination. To compel a forfeiture in this case would work an injustice.         University Cafeteria should thus be permitted to cure its default. Although the bankruptcy court relied on § 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, not on the Virginia principle cited here, this court\'s decision is the same as that reached by the bankruptcy court. Consequently, the decision of the bankruptcy court is affirmed.',

Appeal No. 78-502. United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. June 15, 1978          Joseph F. Nakamura, Washington, D. C., for the Commissioner of Patents, Thomas E. Lynch, Washington, D. C., of counsel.          Before MARKEY, Chief Judge, and RICH, BALDWIN, LANE and MILLER, Judges.          RICH, Judge.          This appeal is from the decision of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) Board of Appeals (board) affirming the rejection of claims 1-5 in appellants\' application serial No. 452,050, filed March 18, 1974, for """"Sub-Critical Time Modulated Control Mechanism,"""" under 35 USC 103 as obvious from U. S. Patent No. 3,430,536 for """"Time Modulated Pneumatically Actuated Control Page 87 Mechanism,"""" issued March 4, 1969, to John A. Oelrich, one of the present joint applicants. We reverse.          The invention relates generally to control mechanisms used, inter alia, to move steering fins on guided missiles. The device responds to an electrical signal from the missile guidance system, variously described as the """"command,"""" """"input,"""" or """"error"""" signal, the magnitude of which is proportional to the desired amount of course-correcting fin movement, and converts this signal into a pneumatic pressure of appropriate magnitude which acts on a piston to move the fin. Before describing the particulars of the claimed invention, we will briefly describe the prior art control devices cited by the PTO which appellants concede to have been the starting point of their invention.          An exemplary embodiment of the prior-art actuator described in the Oelrich patent is illustrated below:          (Image Omitted)          Cyclic energization of solenoid 6 by a periodic carrier signal (illustrated) alternately pressurizes and exhausts piston working area 18. The cycle is so fast that time delays resulting from the size of inlet port 10(Au) and exhaust port 11(Ad) cause a steady-state pressure to be approximated in area 18 which is balanced by constant pressure on piston surface 20 when the control is in the neutral or """"null"""" position. When a command signal (illustrated) is superimposed on the carrier signal in summing amplifier 14, switch 29 responds to the altered signal to alter the relative durations of solenoid energization and solenoid de-energization within each cycle.          For example, a command signal increasing the magnitude of the signal which reaches switch 29 will cause the solenoid to be energized for a greater portion of each cycle than it is de-energized. Accordingly, pressurization time is greater than exhaust time, the approximate steady-state pressure in area 18 is increased, and piston 28 moves to the right, thereby moving the steering fin (not shown). If the command signal decreases the magnitude of the signal reaching switch 29, the solenoid will be de-energized for a greater portion of each cycle than it is energized, exhaust time will be greater than pressurization time, the Page 88 steady-state pressure in area 18 is reduced, and piston 28 moves to the left. Such operation of the actuator is said to be """"time modulated.""""          At any given time, the pressure in area 18 will fluctuate somewhat in accordance with the frequency of the bursts of pressurized gas received therein, which, in turn, depends on the carrier signal frequency. These pressure variations cause slight load (fin) movements attributable to the carrier signal rather than the command signal, and such movement is termed """"dither."""" Some dither is desirable in overcoming friction, often termed """"coulomb friction,"""" which might otherwise cause the control to stick in its neutral position. Such a desirable degree of dither is manifested as a slight vibration of the device. Excessive dither, sufficient to cause significant load (fin) movement, is obviously undesirable. The pressure fluctuations that cause dither are known to depend, inter alia, on the impedance or responsiveness of the load and the carrier signal frequency.          A second factor governing operation of the Oelrich control systems is that each such system has a natural resonant frequency, sometimes termed """"critical frequency."""" When excited by a carrier signal at the critical frequency, system response is out of proportion to input; that is to say, uncontrolled oscillation of the steering fin occurs.          The parties seem to agree that the device disclosed in the Oelrich patent was employed only with the then available steering fins which they characterize as """"high inertia"""" loads. According to Fig. 7 of the Oelrich patent, dither amplitude, expressed in terms of """"dither amplitude ratio,"""" [1] and carrier frequency in systems employing such loads were known to be related generally as follows (increasing spring rate connotes increasing load, and resonant peaks (broken lines) are shown as moving to the right with increases):          (Image Omitted)          The Oelrich patent states that it is Preferred to operate the control using carrier frequencies Above the critical frequency in order to obtain the desired low dither amplitudes in the area where the curves converge. The control there described, however, is subsequently characterized as """"adapted to receive a carrier frequency substantially in excess of the particular system critical or resonant frequency * * *.""""          The Invention          With the advent of light-weight missile steering fins, it became desirable to employ the Oelrich control with Low inertia loads. It was found, however, that the critical frequency of such a system was so high that super-critical operation exceeded the practical capabilities of available solenoids, which are stated to have an upper frequency limit of about 175 Hz. Appellants discovered that the Oelrich control, coupled to a Low inertia load, can be operated with a Sub-critical carrier frequency without incurring unacceptably large dither which, they allege, would have been expected by those of ordinary skill in the art based on the known frequency-response characteristics of High inertia systems. Claims 1 and 2 are illustrative and read (emphasis ours):          1. A time modulated fluid actuated control Apparatus comprising:          housing means, said housing means defining a cylinder; actuator piston means disposed in said housing means cylinder; said piston means including an output member adapted to be connected Page 89 to a movable load, said load and control apparatus defining a system having a range of resonant frequencies;          solenoid operated valve means mounted on said housing means, said valve means being selectively operable to deliver pressurized fluid to and to vent fluid from said housing means cylinder at one side of said piston means;          means for generating variable input command signals commensurate with the desired position of the load, said command signals being characterized by a dynamic frequency range below said range of said resonant frequencies;          Means for generating a signal at a carrier frequency, said carrier frequency being greater than the maximum dynamic command signal frequency and less than the minimum system resonant frequency;          means for modulating said carrier frequency signal by said command signals; and          means responsive to said modulated carrier frequency signal for controlling energization of said solenoid operated valve means.          2. The Method for the control of a pneumatic position control mechanism employing an expansible chamber motor having an output shaft couple (sic) to a movable load, said method comprising the steps of          generating a command signal commensurate with the desired position of the movable load coupled to the control mechanism motor output shaft, the frequency of the command signals being within a range determined by the primary band width of the actuator system including the control mechanism and the load;          Generating a carrier signal at a frequency less than the minimum resonant frequency of the actuator system and greater than the maximum command signal frequency;          modulating the carrier frequency signal with a command signal; and          controlling the delivery of pressurized gas to the position control mechanism expansible chamber motor in accordance with the magnitude of the modulated carrier frequency signal.          The Rejection          The examiner rejected claims 1-5 under 35 U.S.C. s 103 as obvious from the Oelrich patent, noting the reference\'s specific teachings that carrier frequencies yielding """"a degree of dither"""" were desirable and that super-critical operation was merely Preferred. [2] The general teachings of Oelrich that carrier frequency should be selected to optimize system performance indicated to the examiner that selection of a particular carrier frequency was """"a mere choice in design"""" and that optimization of a low-inertia system would have led to the claimed modification.          The Affidavits          In response to the examiner\'s rejection, four affidavits were submitted in an attempt to show that those of ordinary skill in the art would not have known from the Oelrich patent that the control system there described could be operated satisfactorily with a sub-critical carrier frequency, wherefore operation at such frequency would not have been obvious.          Co-inventors Oelrich and Divigard, conceded by the PTO to be men of ordinary skill in the art, separately aver that the claimed modification was not obvious to them. As objective evidence of his assertion that those skilled in the art, such as himself, did not believe that the Oelrich control was suitable for use with sub-critical carrier frequencies, Divigard appended to his affidavit his own published report on the performance of the Oelrich control Page 90 which specified the use of super-critical carrier frequencies. In the same vein, an attachment to Oelrich\'s affidavit indicates that Oelrich and Divigard, when actually confronted with customer requests for adaptations of the Oelrich control to low-inertia systems having very high critical frequencies, did not suggest use of sub-critical carrier frequencies, suggesting, instead, that the whole System be modified to reduce the critical frequency and allow the use of a super-critical carrier frequency.          Friedman, an electrical engineering professor whose credentials as one skilled in the art are unquestioned by the PTO, avers that the use of a sub-critical carrier frequency in an Oelrich-type device would not have been obvious to him.          Kolk, also a professor of electrical engineering of unimpeached qualification as one skilled in the art, analyzes the teachings of Oelrich in detail. The above-noted distinction between desirable and undesirable degrees of dither in systems such as these is pointed out, the perceptible actuator movement associated with the latter being said to cause mechanical wear. Kolk states that one might be tempted to operate in the sub-critical """"valley"""" in the Fig. 7 frequency-response curve except that the """"valley"""" is too shallow to give acceptable degrees of dither, such being encountered in Fig. 7 only above the critical frequency. Even if the """"valley"""" were deeper, super-critical-frequency operation would still have been called for, in Kolk\'s opinion, because of the danger of harmonics of the carrier signal (weaker signals at integral multiples of the carrier frequency) exciting the mechanical resonance or interfering with the command signal. Kolk states that the excessive power required to drive a solenoid at a super-critical frequency in a system with a high resonant frequency and the unreliability introduced by mechanical wear caused by such operation would have led him to reject the Oelrich control for use in low-inertia systems.          Kolk avers that the instantly claimed invention lies in the recognition and utilization of a deep, sub-critical """"valley"""" in the frequency-response curve of low-inertia systems employing the Oelrich control.          The Board          The board, with one member specially concurring, affirmed the examiner\'s rejection noting that all of the affidavits stated that the Oelrich device Should be operated with a super-critical carrier frequency to obtain a Practical system having a certain operational life span. Since the board felt that Oelrich teaches the use of super-critical carrier frequencies merely as """"preferred,"""" it was of the opinion that the use of a sub-critical frequency in a system where large dither could be tolerated would have been obvious. The affidavits are criticized as failing to state factual bases for the conclusion that the reference as a whole does not teach the use of sub-critical frequencies. In essence, the board\'s position was that sub-critical-frequency operation is broadly contemplated by Oelrich, and that the affidavits fail to establish that such operation was thought to be Not possible.          The Arguments          Appellants contend here, as they did before the board, that one of ordinary skill in the art would not have read the Oelrich patent, as a whole, as teaching the use of sub-critical carrier frequencies. The affidavits are alleged to establish that the view prevailing among those working in the art at the time the invention was made was that Oelrich-type control mechanisms simply were not suitable for use with sub-critical carrier frequencies, e. g., in systems with very high critical frequencies.          The solicitor, in defending the board\'s position, has interjected yet another theory upon which he urges the rejection might be sustained. It is alleged that Oelrich, at the very least, suggests running a frequency-response analysis of any system in which use of the Oelrich control was contemplated, and, once a low-inertia system was so analyzed, conventional design criteria outlined by Kolk would have dictated operation in the deep sub-critical """"valley"""" that would have been discovered. To this argument, Page 91 appellants predictably respond by arguing that those of ordinary skill in the art would not have been motivated to run such an analysis, thinking no useful purpose would be served thereby based on their expectation that the Oelrich control was unsuitable for use with sub-critical carrier frequencies.          OPINION           For patentability to be negatived under s 103, the PTO must show that the claimed subject matter would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made. This entails a determination of the scope and content of the prior art, the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art, and the level of ordinary skill in the art. Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed.2d 545, 148 U.S.P.Q. 459 (1966). In so doing, the PTO usually must evaluate both the scope and content of the prior art and the level of ordinary skill solely on the cold words of the literature. When only the literature is relied upon, occasionally one or both of these factual inquiries becomes distorted. In re Palmer, 451 F.2d 1100, 59 C.C.P.A. 733, 172 U.S.P.Q. 126 (1971). In our opinion, this is such a case.          The evidence of record bearing on the content of the prior art and the level of ordinary skill consists of the words of the Oelrich patent and the affidavits of four persons conceded to have been of ordinary skill in the art. If the affidavits are to be believed, then statements in the Oelrich patent implying that a sub-critical carrier frequency is feasible, albeit not """"preferred,"""" must be dismissed as speculation.           Even if speculative, statements appearing in the prior-art literature are good, for purposes of rejection under s 103, for all that they would fairly suggest to one of ordinary skill in the art. See In re Wiggins, 488 F.2d 538, 179 U.S.P.Q. 421 (Cust. & Pat.App.1973); In re Trbojevich, 361 F.2d 1013, 53 C.C.P.A. 1241, 150 U.S.P.Q. 50 (1966). In determining how the Oelrich disclosure was interpreted by those skilled in the art, we are more impressed by what those so skilled Did than by what they Said. Even though the words of the Oelrich patent implied that sub-critical operation was feasible, it was never, in fact, considered when a concrete problem requiring such operation was actually presented to two persons of ordinary skill in the art, both intimately familiar with the Oelrich patent. The actions of those skilled in the art reflected by this record indicate that the speculative statements in the Oelrich patent were recognized as such and ignored by those working in the art. The opinions of two other experts are in accord.          We believe the board\'s criticism of the affidavits for failing to recite factual bases for the conclusions reached is unwarranted in this case. To the extent above noted, the affidavits of Oelrich and Divigard are based on facts. The Kolk affidavit is grounded, in large part, on technically sound applications of unquestioned physical principles. To the extent that all of the affidavits express opinions, they are the opinions of men conceded to be of ordinary skill in the art based on information uniquely within their competence bearing on the level of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made. Their conclusions are reasonable, and thus more credible, in view of the fact that only a single word (""""preferred"""") in the entire eighteen columns of disclosure in the Oelrich patent is in any way contrary thereto.           While we concur in the sentiment expressed by the board that showings of fact are much preferred to statements of opinion, we are of the view that the nature of the matter sought to be established, as well as the strength of the opposing evidence, must be taken into consideration in assessing the probative value of expert opinion. In this case, the expert opinions were introduced on the issue of the level of ordinary skill, which is usually determined by reference to the subjective reaction of persons so skilled, In re Meng, 492 F.2d 843, 181 U.S.P.Q. 94 (Cust. & Pat.App.1974), and are opposed by a fragile prima facie case of obviousness. In our opinion, the affidavits were sufficient to shift the burden of going forward with the evidence back to the PTO, Page 92. and that burden has not been sustained. In other words, the prima facie case of obviousness has been overcome.           The solicitor correctly contends that had one conducted a frequency-response analysis on a low-inertia-load system, he would have discovered, as did appellants, that sub-critical control was feasible. The question under s 103, however, is not whether one skilled in the art doing what appellants did would have discovered what appellants discovered, but whether it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to do what appellants did. In re Lemin, 364 F.2d 864, 53 C.C.P.A. 1382, 150 U.S.P.Q. 546 (1966). In view of the affidavits submitted, we think not.          The decision of the board is reversed.          REVERSED. --------- Notes: [1] """"Dither amplitude ratio"""" is the ratio of actuator output motion to the amplitude of the duty cycle (carrier signal). [2] Nobody has at any time asserted that apparatus claim 1 is Anticipated by Oelrich, and we choose not to consider the question de novo here on appeal. If the question did not turn on facts not of record, e. g., the nature of the Oelrich signal generator, we would be more inclined to reach the issue under the rationale of In re Pearson, 494 F.2d 1399, 181 U.S.P.Q. 641 (Cust. & Pat.App.1974). ---------',
